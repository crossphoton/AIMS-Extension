# AIMS Chrome Extension

This is initial part. Motive is to integrate with an Android app.

## How to use

As we currently do not have any profile on Chrome Web Store we have to install this in developer mode. There's a sponsor button though xD (Just kidding).

### Windows

- Download the Source Code from Releases section (Prefer `.zip`)
- Extract the downloaded archive.
- Go to `chrome://extensions`
- Enable Developer Mode (available on right side)
- Click on `Load Unpacked`
- Select the folder you extracted above.
- Enjoy the extension available in the toolbar.

### Linux / Mac

- Download the .crx file from Release section
- Go to `chrome://extensions`
- Enable Developer Mode (available on right side)
- Drag and drop the downloaded crx file.
- Enjoy the extension available in the toolbar.
